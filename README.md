# MarkdownEditor
A simple Mac Markdown editor with live preview. 

## Note on Code Blocks

This editor uses [the Ink parser](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Ink), which currently does not support the common method of using indentation to designate Markdown code blocks.

You must add three backticks above and below the code block, such as the following:

 ```` 
 ```
  // Your code block here
 ``` 
 ````
